Used Packages

Among the packages utilized in the development of my mobile application are Hive, which provides a lightweight and fast NoSQL database; easy_localization, facilitating the addition of multi-language support; get_it, aiding in dependency injection management; uuid, utilized for generating unique identifiers; hive_flutter, enabling Hive integration in Flutter applications; and Lottie, used for integrating animations. I employed these packages to optimize the performance of my application, provide multi-language support, manage dependencies, and enhance visual appeal.
